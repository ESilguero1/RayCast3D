# RayCast3D

A pseudo-3D graphics library for the ST7735R display using raycasting techniques.

## Overview

RayCast3D is designed for ECE 319K students working with the MSPM0 microcontroller. It provides a simple interface for rendering pseudo-3D environments on the ST7735R LCD display using raycasting algorithms.

## Hardware Requirements

- MSPM0 MCU
- ST7735R LCD Display

## Dependencies

This library requires the following external Valvanoware files:

- `inc/Clock.h` / `Clock.c` - Clock configuration and delay functions
- `file.h` / `file.c` - File system support

These files are provided in the ECE 319K Valvanoware distribution and should be placed in an `inc/` directory at the same level as the `RayCast3D/` folder.

## Getting Started

See the course materials for integration instructions and usage examples.

## License

For educational use in ECE 319K.
